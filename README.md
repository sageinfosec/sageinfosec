## 🌟 My Cybersecurity Journey
After years in other industries, I made the decision to transition into cybersecurity — a field that combines my love for problem-solving, technology, and protecting people.  
I’m currently focused on learning the fundamentals of cyber defense, building technical confidence through hands-on labs, and developing the soft skills that are just as vital in real-world environments.  
My ultimate goal is to become a **Junior Vulnerability Analyst**, and eventually transition into **ethical hacking** as I grow in my career.

I go by **Sage** professionally, but you’ll see my legal name **Diamond** on certificates and credentials.
